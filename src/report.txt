Limits variable length to 8 characters
Reduced register use

Optimizations:
I have used a queue for register allocation. When a register is no longer in used it is placed in the queue. 
When requesting a register to use the getRegister() function first looks in the queue. If the queue is empty
it then gets a new register. If the queue is not empty it polls the queue for a register to use.
